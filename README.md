APoD eXplorer: NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day image collection explorer
============================================================================

APoD eXplorer is an interactive exploration platform to visualise large image collections. 
In particlar, we visualise here the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day image collection (~800 images).

Several interfaces are proposed to explore the collection:
1. a content-based recommendation interface,
2. a timeline interface (one per year),
3. a hierarchical and graph-based hybrid structure exploration interface.

APoD eXplorer has been developed during my PhD, entitled *Interactive, incremental and multi-level exploration of large collections of images*.
This PhD has been defended in November the 22nd, 2016 in the University François-Rabelais of Tours.

APoD eXplorer can be tested online in my homepage: [http://frederic.rayar.free.fr/apod/](http://frederic.rayar.free.fr/apod/).

APoD eXplorer has been developed with web technologies, namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Third-party librairies are AngularJS, Linkurious.js and Timeline.js
